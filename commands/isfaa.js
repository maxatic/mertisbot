        Yes, ISFAA is a free version of CSS but not all schools accept ISFAA so you need to email each school youâ€™re applying to and ask whether they accept ISFAA. When asking for css fee waivers certain schools will allow you to send the ISFAA (Pomona, Dartmouth, Bennington, Swarthmore etc.)` );

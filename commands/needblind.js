        Need blind schools don’t discriminate against an applicant based on their ability to pay(This DOES NOT mean that they meet your full demonstrated need). However, the number of need-blind schools for internationals is very low(HYPM, Amherst, NYU Abu Dhabi, Yale-NUS claim to be need-blind). Need aware schools do take into consideration the applicant’s ability to pay. The lower your EFC the lower are your chances of getting into need-aware schools. However, if you are admitted the university will in most cases meet your full demonstrated need.` );

Extracurriculars are extremely important and T20s and top LACs weigh them heavily. Make sure you try to show some form of leadership in any EC that you can. Remember: Having a spike in a few is far better than being a jack of all trades. However, if you can do your best in various ECs, that’s even better. 
		
** What are considered ECs? **
ECs are any activities you take outside the classroom. They could be community service, sports, helping your parents with chores or any other productive activity outside the classroom.
	
** What are good ECs? **
A lot of times when somebody asks this question, they’re trying to gauge which ECs will appeal to top schools and which ECs won’t. This is a bad idea as top schools care about authenticity and taking part in ECs for the sake of appealing to schools is never a good idea. Admissions officers at top schools have enough experience to see which activities you truly care about and which activities are there just to pad your resume. 
		
With that being said, a good EC is anything you have put a lot of time and effort into. A good EC for one applicant could be playing table tennis at the national stage whereas a good EC for another applicant could be planting trees across their community or raising awareness about the pitfalls of poor education in their country. Once again, try to show initiative and leadership in your ECs if possible!` );
